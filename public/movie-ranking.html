    <h1>The Best Movies According to Divyam</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>in my POV its a very chill movie . the humour and the quote lines by Farhan Akhtar are really stupendous . the story revolves around 3 friends on a bachelor spain trip where each of the friend eradicates the inside fear of themselves .</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>of course a hit by Christopher Nolan . what else could be expected from movie directed by sir Christopher Nolan . in the movie its based on all physics theories , time travelling and is a really cool sci fi to watch . </p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>The Oscar winning movie starring Cillian Murphy as Robert J Oppenheimer has done a great job and depicted the first nuclear bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki including the scientific and political aspect happened at that time . </p>
